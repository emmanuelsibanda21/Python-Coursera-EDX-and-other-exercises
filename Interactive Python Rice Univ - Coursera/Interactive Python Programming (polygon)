'''There are several ways to calculate the area of a regular polygon. Given the number of sides, n, and the length of each side, s, the polygon's area is

ns24tan(Ï€n)
For example, a regular polygon with 5 sides, each of length 7 inches, has area 84.3033926289 square inches.

Write a function that calculates the area of a regular polygon, given the number of sides and length of each side. Submit the area of a regular polygon with 7 sides each of length 3 inches. Enter a number (and not the units) with at least four digits of precision after the decimal point.

import math

    return num_sides * length**2 / (4* math.tan(math.pi/num_sides))

print("The answer is:", area_of_polygon(7, 3))
