''''Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)'''

#user must input a number
#check to see if user input is integer, if not notify user of requirement
#create a for loop to iterate through all numbers between 1 and user input numbers
#check to see if numbers in for loop can divide into user input, if they can add numbers to variable
#return all integers in variable

try:
  x = int(input("Please enter a number: "))
  divisors = [i for i in range(1,x) if x % i == 0]
