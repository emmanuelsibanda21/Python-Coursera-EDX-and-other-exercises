'''Letâ€™s say I give you a list saved in a variable: a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]. Write one
line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list
in it.'''

#for loop that iterates through list a
#if statement to check whether variable is even or not
#if variable is an even number, add variable to new list
