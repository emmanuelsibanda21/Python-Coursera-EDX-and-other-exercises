'''Write a program (using functions!) that asks the user for a long string containing multiple words. Print back to the user the same string, except with the words in backwards order. For example, say I type the string:
'My name is Michele'
Then I would see the string:
'Michele is name My'
shown back to me.'''

#create a function that takes 1 argument
#function must split argument and throw the strings into a list
#use whitespace to split argument
#reverse the list
#put the list back into string format
#return result

def Reverse(string):
  split_string = string.split(" ")
  list_string = [i for i in split_string]
  new_list = list(reversed(list_string))
  joint_list = ' '.join(new_list)
  print(joint_list)
