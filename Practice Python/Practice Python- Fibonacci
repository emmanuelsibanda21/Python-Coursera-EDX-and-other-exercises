'''Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonnaci numbers to generate and then generates them. Take this opportunity to think about how you can use functions. Make sure to ask the user to enter the number of numbers in the sequence to generate.(Hint: The Fibonnaci seqence is a sequence of numbers where the next number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence. The sequence looks like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, â€¦)'''

#ask for user input
#make sure input is an integer
#store user input in variable
#calculate sequence of fib numbers until 'n'. 'n' being the the user's input
#add fib numbers to list
#return list
