'''Write a password generator in Python. Be creative with how you generate passwords - strong passwords have a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The passwords should be random, generating a new password every time the user asks for a new password. Include your run-time code in a main method.

Extra:

Ask the user how strong they want their password to be. For weak passwords, pick a word or two from a list.'''
#allow users to choose between strong and weak password
#if user chooses a strong password return 8 random digits, string and punctuation symbols
#if the user chooses a weak password, randomly pick a word on a list

import string
import random
strong = "strong"
weak = "weak"
list_of_choices = [weak, strong]
choice = input("Select your desired password strength: " + ' '.join(list_of_choices) + "\n")
if choice == strong:
    strong_password = ''.join(random.SystemRandom().choice(string.ascii_letters + string.punctuation + string.digits) for i in range(8))
    print ("Your new password is: {0}".format(strong_password))
elif choice == weak:
    weak_list = ["pass123", "wordpass", "weakpass"]
    weak_password = random.choice(weak_list)
    print ("Your new password is: {0}".format(weak_password))
