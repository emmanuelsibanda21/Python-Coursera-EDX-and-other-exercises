'''Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user.

Extras:

If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different message.
Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it num) and one number to divide by (check). If check divides evenly into num, tell that to the user. If not, print a different appropriate message.'''

#ask user for a number
#check if number is an odd or even number
#check if number is divisible by 4
#if number is even print out even
#if number is odd print out odd
#if number is a multiple of 4 print out message indicating this
#also decided to store odd, even numbers and multiples of of 4 for fun
