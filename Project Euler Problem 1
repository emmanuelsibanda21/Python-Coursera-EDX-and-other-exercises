'''Project Euler: Problem 1
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.'''
#run through all numbers from 1 to 1000
#check if numbers are multiples of 3 or 5
#store numbers in variable
#add all numbers in variable
x = [ i for i in range(1000) if i % 3 ==0 or i % 5 ==0]
total = sum(x)
print(total)
