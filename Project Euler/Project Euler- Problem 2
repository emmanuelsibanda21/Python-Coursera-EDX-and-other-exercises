'''
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.'''
#represent fibonnaci pattern in python (sum of previous 2 numbers)
#find numbers under or equal to 4MM that are part of fib sequence
#from fib numbers, find numbers that are even numbers
#store numbers in variable
#add numbers in variable
