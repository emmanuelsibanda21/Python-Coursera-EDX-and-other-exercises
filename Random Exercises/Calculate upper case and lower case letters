'''Write a program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of upper case letters and lower case letters.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
Hello world!
Then, the output should be:
UPPER CASE 1
LOWER CASE 9'''
#changed the wording of the output
#also counted non letter characters in string

def count_upper(word):
  upper_count = 0
  lower_count = 0
  whitespace = 0
  for i in word:
    if i == i.upper() and str.isalpha(i) == True: upper_count +=1
    elif i == i.lower() and str.isalpha(i) == True: lower_count +=1
    else: whitespace +=1
  print('This sentence has {0} upper case letters, {1} lower case letters and {2} non letter characters'.format(upper_count, lower_count, whitespace))

#testcases
count_upper('UPPER CASE')
count_upper('Hello world!')
count_upper('THe ThInG thAt CanNot be ConCeivEd Is THIS')
