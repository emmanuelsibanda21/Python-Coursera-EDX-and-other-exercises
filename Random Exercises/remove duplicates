'''Write a program that accepts a sequence of whitespace separated words as input and prints the words after removing all duplicate words and sorting them alphanumerically.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
hello world and practice makes perfect and hello world again
Then, the output should be:
again and hello makes perfect practice world

Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.
We use set container to remove duplicated data automatically and then use sorted() to sort the data.'''

#import re module to split multiple delimiters
#take in a sequence of words/strings
#split string by comma, whitespace etc
#check for duplicates, add words that do not have duplicates into new list
#print new list

import re
string = input('Enter your sentence here')
sep_string = re.split(',| ', string)
final_list = []
[final_list.append(x) for x in sep_string if x not in final_list]
