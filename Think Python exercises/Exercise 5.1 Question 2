'''Fermat’s Last Theorem says that there are no integers a, b, and c such that
a
n +b
n = c
n
for any values of n greater than 2.

2. Write a function that prompts the user to input values for a, b, c and n, converts them to
integers, and uses check_fermat to check whether they violate Fermat’s theorem.'''
