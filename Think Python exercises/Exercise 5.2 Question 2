'''Exercise 5.2 If you are given three sticks, you may or may not be able to arrange them in a triangle.
For example, if one of the sticks is 12 inches long and the other two are one inch long, it is clear
that you will not be able to get the short sticks to meet in the middle. For any three lengths, there is
a simple test to see if it is possible to form a triangle:

“If any of the three lengths is greater than the sum of the other two, then you cannot
form a triangle. Otherwise, you can.”

Write a function that prompts the user to input three stick lengths, converts them to integers,
and uses is_triangle to check whether sticks with the given lengths can form a triangle.'''

#find the maximum number, add all the numbers together then subtract the maximum from the total. If the maximum is greater than the total then this is not a triangle
def is_triangle(a,b,c):
    triangle = a,b,c
    triangle_size = a+b+c-max(triangle)
    if max(triangle) > triangle_size:
        print('No')
    else:
        print('Yes')
def user_input():
    try: #if you enter anything other than an integer you will get a print statement telling you to enter a number and call the function again
        a,b,c = int(input('Enter a value for a:\n')), int(input('Enter a value for b:\n')), int(input('Enter a value for c:\n'))
    except:
        print('You are supposed to enter an integer, please call the function again')
    is_triangle(a,b,c)

user_input()
